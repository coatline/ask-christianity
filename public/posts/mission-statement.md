We try to accurately align our minds with **reality**.

We encourage people to **pursue truth** by asking the most important questions in life and allowing the evidence to speak for itself. We challenge people to take Christianity’s truth claims seriously, not only because we believe that Christianity is **true**, but because **it’s good**!

We urge Christians to know **what they believe**, and **why they believe it!** They should be able to effectively communicate good reasons that Christianity is **objectively true**. We also challenge Christians to put their beliefs into action by **living consistently** and **working hard** to follow Jesus.

Our mission can be summed up in two phrases:

**Pursue Truth. Be Transformed.**
