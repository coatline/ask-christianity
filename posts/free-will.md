# The Free Will Debate!

I'd like to start this post by making an observation on how having a discussion about free will typically goes. Here's a mock example of how I would say 90% of free will conversations happen.

Calvin: "I don't believe in free will, man. I believe in the sovereignty of God. Don't you believe that God is in control?"

Wesley: "Of course I believe that God is in control. He can intervene in history whenever he wants. I just believe that we have the free will to make decisions."

Calvin: "But every decision we make has been predetermined by God, so we don't have free will."

Wesley: "What do you mean that we don't have free will?"

Calvin: "I mean that we don't actually make choices, we're just doing what God has already laid out for us."

Wesley: "But I overwhelmingly see that in the Bible, it is assumed that we have the ability to make choices."

Calvin: "Well, what about these versus that clearly indicate that God predestined everything? *lists verses*

Stalemate.

Notice what went wrong. First, sovereignty was never defined. Apparently, both Calvin and Wesley agree that God is in control, so why did sovereignty even come up?

Second, free will was minimally defined. The best thing that happened in this example was that Wesley asked: "What do you mean that we don't have free will?" Calvin's theological response led Wesley to counter theologically, leading to a verse-vs-verse battle, where both sides remain where they began.

Debates like this are unproductive because neither side clearly defines what they mean. Each person fails to understand the other person's position, while at times assuming that they do understand the other person's position!

That's why when someone pulls out the term "free will," never assume that you know what they mean by it. In fact, I suggest that you should avoid ever using the term. Instead, state exactly what you believe about humanity's ability to make choices.

Let's begin by building a mental model of the fundamental questions behind this debate. Start by asking: "What is the cause behind your actions?" Most people agree that 'you' are behind your actions, whether they believe that our actions are predetermined or not. But they may disagree on what 'you' are. Here, 'you' is referring to the decision-making process. More specifically, it is the process that takes some inputs (like prior experiences) and outputs a decision.

This debate depends entirely on a single question: "Is our decision-making process deterministic?" Answering this question clarifies what is actually being claimed without relying on overused terms like "free will" or "the ability to choose." These terms obscure the issue because the real disagreement lies in what is meant by 'you', which we have defined as our decision-making process. Simply asserting that we "have free will" does not advance the discussion unless we explain how that decision-making process operates.

Setting aside the biblical/theological implications of each view, let's take a look at how each of these possibilities hold up.

1. Our decision are NOT deterministic:

If our decisions are not deterministic, it may 

2. Out decisions are deterministic

And I want to focus on one question in particular because I think that it gets at the heart of the issue: "Are 'you' the 'uncaused first-cause' of your actions or are they simply the effect of prior causes?"

Now this is getting really interesting. We've escaped the discussion of vague labels to talking about the actual mechanics behind those labels. If we can detail our decision-making process, we can understand how to better answer a host of downstream questions, such as moral responsibility.

As we know, the brain is the epicenter of all of our decisions, so to understand this process, we have to touch on some neuroscience and psychology. Even if we possess some immaterial spiritual element that plays a role in our thinking, it would still need to interface with the brain to produce an action. Plus, there's no way to analyze a spiritual element, so any theories would require an existing framework to make sense in. There are four main theories regarding the decision-making process:

Dual Process Theory (most popular theory)

The Somatic Marker Hypothesis

Predictive Processing

Global Workspace Theory

I don't want to go into too much detail regarding each of these theories, but it is important that we discuss the common consensus between them all.

Firstly, the consensus of neuroscience is that the there's a part of your brain  .

What's the difference between us and other animals then? We reason. We are conscious. What is consciousness???? We make deliberate choices. We have the ability to overcome our instincts/feelings whereas other animals have no intermediate step of logic or reason between information and action. We have moral obligations.

But can you have moral obligations without the power of self-determination? What is self? Can you have moral obligations even if you are completely predictable and machine-like? 

Do we always do what our most desire is? If so, that's deterministic. Otherwise, how can we come to different conclusions? What changes in the equation that makes it to where we can come to different conclusions?

If my environment only shapes my desires, is it fair that my desires are predetermined?

If "you" are a combination of physical processes that emergently produces consciousness, you definitely are a machine. You are a biological machine that can comprehend that you exist.

AI Generated: The "Illusion of First Cause": Neurological studies (like the famous Libet experiments) suggest that the brain initiates the "readiness potential" for a movement before the person is even aware of their decision to move. If the subconscious starts the car before the "You" puts its hands on the wheel, who is actually driving? Dual Process Theory

Is it nothing? If it's nothing, then what about the law of causality?

Is it something? If something causes my decisions, am I really free?

Therefore let anyone who thinks that he stands take heed lest he fall. 13 No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it. - 1 Corinthians 10:12-13

Given the exact same prior conditions (physical, historical, & spiritual), could you have chosen differently than you did?

If yes, how?

If no, does God control our choices directly, or are there other factors that come into play? 

It may be a bit controversial, but I believe that for this question, it's more helpful to look to our experience of how reality works (metaphysics) than it is to look at what the Bible says (theology). I say this because the Bible already seems to emphasize both human responsibility AND God's hand in the world. So, as Christians, I would say that regardless of whether or not we have the ability to make choices independent of our environment

AI Generated: Most modern Christians actually live in a weird middle ground—praying as if everything depends on God (Calvinism), but preaching as if everything depends on the listener’s choice (Arminianism).

There are so many ideas surrounding the term, that even when it is clearly defined, people will still refer back to their own definition. Therefore, I will state my case by describing the ideas behind my claim.

My first claim may seem unrelated, but you'll see that it's very relevant. My first claim is this: Every cause has exactly one effect.

When humans make decisions, they think in some way. Psychologists Daniel Kahneman makes a distinction between "fast thinking" and "slow thinking."

How do human beings come to decisions? we "weigh" our collective experiences including our perceptions, emotions, physical state, social situation, context, and personal values. When we "weigh" our experiences, use a combination of logic, emotion, and past experience. we use Well, it all starts with our perception of our current situation. Our perception is based on our memory, senses, and context. For example, when you may notice that you feel hungry. The next

Daniel Kahneman makes a distinction between "fast thinking" and "slow thinking." Fast thinking is automatic, used in pattern recognition and survival instincts, and dominates our daily lives. Slow thinking can override fast thinking, but it's lazy, meaning that it doesn't always.

Operates with little effort or conscious control.

Good for everyday judgments, pattern recognition, and survival instincts.

Oversimplification: It implies that all decisions are consciously “weighed,” but many decisions are automatic or intuitive (System 1 thinking in Kahneman’s framework). No mention of biases or heuristics: Human decision-making is influenced by cognitive biases, not just rational evaluation. No environmental or external constraints: Decisions are also shaped by time pressure, resource limitations, social norms, or authority influence. Lacks feedback loop: Experiences shape future decisions, but that dynamic isn’t addressed.

When a human being makes a decision, they evaluate their current situation and desires.

Every cause has exactly one effect.

So, what's my claim? My claim is that human beings, do not have the ability to act independently of their experiences.

First of all, this is an untestable claim, since we cannot set up a situation where we have the exact same experiences. However, we can look to other forms of evidence to reason about what we would do.

My first claim is that we, as human beings, cannot act independently of our experiences.

My next claim is that it is reasonable to believe that the Universe is deterministic by nature. Everything that has a beginning has a cause. Every cause has exactly one effect, and can only have one effect. In other words, if every causal action is kept constant including:

The way that God caused the Universe to come into existance

The way that the spiritual forces interact in the Universe

My claim is that it is reasonable to believe that the Universe is deterministic. Precisely, if God created another Universe, all of its physical and spiritual properties would turn out the exact same IF:

God begins it in the exact same way

God intervenes in the Universe in the exact same way

The spiritual forces act in the exact same way

 keeping the physical components constant and if God intervenes into it in the same exact way 

I believe that the Universe is deterministic as long as God 

There is no way to test this claim, since we don't have the ability to rewind time and see if we would act differently.

Given the exact same prior conditions (physical, historical, & spiritual), could you have chosen differently than you did? Does our environment (and our nature) influence our choices, or does it cause them? In other words, If God rewound the universe to the exact moment before you made a decision, keeping every single causal factor consistent, could you have chosen otherwise?
